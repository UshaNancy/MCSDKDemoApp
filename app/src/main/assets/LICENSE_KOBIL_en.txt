EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE RANGE OF THE GRANTED RIGHTS OF USE 
AND THE WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS


IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

This declaration concerning the range of the granted rights of use and 
the warranty and liability limitations represents a contractual agreement 
between you (i.e. either a natural person or a legal entity) and KOBIL Systems 
GmbH ("KOBIL") concerning the exploitation of the earlier mentioned products 
according to their provision including the entity of singular software files, 
hardware specific files (drivers), storage media and including the attached 
printed or online documentation ("Software").

BY MEANS OF AN INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE, A MULTIPLICATION OR ANY 
UTILIZATION IN ANOTHER MANNER YOU WILL FULLY AGREE WITH THE CONDITIONS 
OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT:

As far as you are the original purchaser of the Software and you do not 
agree to the conditions of the license contract you are entitled to return 
the unutilized software without any delay versus refund of your license fee 
to the authorized dealer/distributor. As far as you fully agree with the 
conditions, KOBIL will grant to you the subsequent provisions which will be 
explained in more detail concerning the exploitation of the software under 
usual use and condition.

The entity of commercial patents (trade-mark rights) is due to KOBIL or her 
suppliers. The software is subject to the protection of copyright and the 
international copyright agreements. On this basic you are liable to treat 
the software like any other product being subject to copyright provisions. 
(e.g. like a book). Moreover, you are however entitled to produce one 
(1) archival copy of the software for backup or archival purposes or, 
alternatively, store the software on one (1) single hard disk and to keep 
the original exclusively for backup or storage purposes.

You are entitled to transfer the right of use permanently to a third person  
or party. The precondition for this is that you do 
not retain any copies of the software and the receiver will accept 
these explanations. Unless otherwise provided and contained in this 
license agreement, you are not entitled to transfer, sublease or rent, 
to copy, to treat or to modify any arrangements of the software 
including remedial actions on the software, storage media or documentation 
to any other person. You are also not entitled to translate, sublicense, 
utilize in timeshare mode the software or documentation or transmit or 
receive it through electronic transmission media. You are made aware 
of the fact, that the source code of the software represents a commercial secret 
of KOBIL and/or her suppliers. You are therefore neither entitled to revise the 
software nor to reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble it. The 
legal provisions, however, will insofar not be affected by the previous conditions.

As far as you have purchased an "update" of a software this will represent an 
inseparable entity with the original KOBIL-Software or that to be upgraded. 
Any exploitation or resale of the upgrade of the software will therefore only be 
permissible on the basis of the provisions of this license agreement. The 
granted rights related to the purchase of  the upgrade will in particularsolely entitle 
you to the exploitation of those software files which will have modifications 
versus the version of the software which is subject to upgrading. The software 
provisions are subject to the German Law for Foreign Economics and the German Decree 
for Foreign Economics. In case of a sale within a  member country of  
the European Community an exploitation under normal use and conditions in the 
entire area of the European Union and any of her treaty states of the agreement 
on the European Economic Community will be permissible. 

The software contains possibly source codes, transferable files and/or other files 
which have been provided by external suppliers (Third Party Software). Since 
for the employment of Third Party Software license provisions of the external 
supplier could become effective you will have to observe the license provisions of 
the external supplier (where applicable) which are contained in the online-documentation. 
In any case the license provisions of the external supplier will be valid in supplement 
however not in place of this license agreement. Above that, KOBIL is reserving any 
proprietary rights on the source code, the transferable files and any other files. 
Without respect to any proceedings made by yourself you are not entitled to disseminate 
files (in particular the source code of KOBIL and other non executable files). 
Subject to the legal provisions you are entitled to gain knowledge of the source 
code of the files KOBIL has made at your disposition only in a machine readable form 
or to multiply, treat, exploit or disseminate the source code.

For any information about eventually applicable license fees or additional 
license provisions with regard to a further going exploitation and/or a further proliferation 
of transferable files please address directly to KOBIL.

LIMITED WARRANTY

KOBIL warrants for a period of 6 months after the date of 
delivery of the software that the software under normal use 
and conditions will be free of entirely unsignificant differences 
from the Instructions for Use contained in the documentation, will 
function and that the delivered software storage media will be free 
of defects in material and workmanship. KOBIL does not warrant that 
the operation of the software will meet your requirements or 
operate free from error.

Should the software or the storage medium proves defective within 
the warranty period mentioned above, KOBIL will at first have the 
right to make investigations on the software and the storage medium and 
to take remedial action by the issue of a new program version of the 
software or in another way resp. to replace the defective storage medium in 
its entity or in parts. In case the replacement delivery or remedial actions 
will not remedy the defect within an adequate period of time, you will 
be entitled, after setting an adequate (post.-term) deadline at your choice, 
to cancel the license agreement or to a reasonable reduction of the license fees.

KOBIL is not obliged to warranty if the defect can be derived from an accident 
which will occur after delivery of the software, as far as the defect could 
be derived from any exploitation other than the normal conditions of operations and 
use, or as far as the software has not been properly installed on a 
computer for which a license was granted hereunder. With the claim of warranty 
rights you will be obliged to prove the data of purchase of the software by 
means of a copy of the invoice.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

KOBIL will only be liable for defects which will be caused by KOBIL or her, 
accomplices either in a gross negligent or wilful way. Moreover KOBIL will 
also be liable for such defects which have been caused by KOBIL or her accomplices 
within the fullfilment of a significant contractual duty in a negligent manner. 
In case of liability in spite of a neither wilful nor gross negligent deviation 
from significant contractual duties, the liability will be limited to the amount 
which can be reduced to a typically predictable damage.

These limitations of liability will apply for any liability, no matter which juristic 
reason, in particular also for a liability caused by the negligence of pre-contractual 
or minor contractual obligations. Excluded from this are, however, any liabilities 
with regard to the Product Liability Law as well as a liability for assured 
properties, as far as the assurance was designated to protect you as a 
customer just from the occurred damage.

You are obliged in the general terms of obligation to lesson damages to take care 
of adequate security provisions for the protection of your data and other software
 and to produce backup copies in such adequate timely distances as are deemed necessary
 in your area of operations as usual with respect to the carefulness of a professional 
user of electronic data processing.

ACTIVITIES RELATED TO HIGH RISKS

The software is not tolerant to failure and has not been developed or produced 
to function as online-control device in dangerous environments or for the 
purpose of resale for such operations which do require operations free of 
interference, as e.g. for the operation in nuclear equipments, flight 
control systems, communication systems, air traffic control systems, 
direct life-supporting devices or weapon systems, with which the malfunction 
of the software could cause death, personal harms or serious physical injures 
("High Risk Activities"). KOBIL and her suppliers explicitely  deny any 
explicite or indirect warranty for the ability in case of High Risk Activities.

CONCLUSIVE PROVISIONS

Any amendments to this agreement are subject to written form and have 
to be signed by you and a representative of KOBIL. As far as parts of 
this agreement are ineffective or cannot be agreed on or become so, the 
effectiveness or accomplishment of the remaining provisions of this
 licence agreement will not be effected by these facts. The parties 
are obliged in this case to agree instead of the provision proves
 ineffective upon an effective provision which will be meeting the 
economical purpose of this license agreement in the most adequate way.
This license agreement is subject to the Legislation of the Federal
 Republic of Germany under exclusion of the UN-Purchase Rights.
The court of jurisdiction for all kinds of legal arguments which 
result directly from this agreement or in correspondence with this
 agreement will be - as far as you are a merchant in the legal 
sense - the site of KOBIL. KOBIL in this case will also be entitled 
to take legal action at any other legal court of jurisdiction.
